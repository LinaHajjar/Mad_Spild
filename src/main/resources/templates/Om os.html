        <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
        <p>Did you know that a third of all food produced globally ends up as waste? This isn’t just a loss of food – it’s a waste of all the resources that went into producing it, including water, energy, and labor. Food waste also contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating climate change. We’re here to change that narrative by reducing food waste at every level of the supply chain, from production to households.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to inspire and empower communities to prevent food waste through education, innovation, and collaboration. By providing tools, resources, and practical solutions, we aim to help individuals, businesses, and institutions make informed choices that benefit both people and the planet.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>We envision a world where food waste is a problem of the past, where resources are respected, and everyone has access to the food they need. Our goal is to create a sustainable system where food is shared, valued, and utilized fully, ensuring a healthier environment and a stronger community.</p>

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Education & Awareness:</strong> Through workshops, campaigns, and educational programs, we raise awareness about the impact of food waste and how simple actions can make a big difference.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration with Businesses:</strong> We work closely with restaurants, supermarkets, and food producers to implement waste-reducing practices, helping them to optimize their processes and donate surplus food to those in need.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Programs:</strong> Our food rescue initiatives redirect edible food to those who need it most, bridging the gap between excess and scarcity in our communities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thank you for visiting us! Together, we can transform the way we produce, consume, and value food. Let’s make a meaningful impact, one saved meal at a time.</p>
